						<P> Chad Bartos, owner of Regent Flooring Inc. (Regent) in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, reviewed the August results from his second month in business. Sales had been slow during the summer months, but Bartos had expected this outcome, knowing the start-up nature of a new business and the fact that the summer months were usually slow in the flooring industry.
						Bartos was preparing for a busy fall (September to November), a time when homeowners regularly undertook renovations. As such, he projected monthly demand of 750 square metres1 of flooring. As he looked forward to the increase in orders, Bartos wondered whether the current manufacturing set-up could handle this demand – or possibly even greater demand – and in what area the equipment capacity was likely to be tightest. As well, how soon would he have to consider making equipment and other changes to Regent’s production?</P>

						<P>Regent produced high-quality, finished, tri-laminated flooring made of oak, maple and bamboo. The firm’s products were sold to local retail flooring centres, which in turn sold the flooring to primarily middle-income homeowners. The tri-laminated flooring had three layers: the top layer was a 0.4-centimetre piece of hardwood; the middle layer, called the core, was a 1.2-centimetre layer of high-density fibreboard; and the third layer, called the stabilizing layer, was a 0.4-centimetre thick piece of plywood with compact elastic paper attached to one side (see Exhibit 1). The finished flooring was constructed in four distinct stages: cutting, gluing, moulding and finishing.</P>
